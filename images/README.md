# FM Transmitter Project

This project is a DIY FM transmitter that allows you to broadcast audio from your device to nearby FM radios. It's a fun and educational project suitable for beginners and hobbyists interested in electronics and radio transmission.

## Features

- **Easy to Build**: The transmitter circuit uses commonly available components and can be assembled on a breadboard.
- **Adjustable Frequency**: Tune the transmitter to any FM frequency within the legal range.
- **Compact Design**: The circuit is designed to be compact and portable, making it easy to carry around.
- **Compatible with Various Audio Sources**: Connect your smartphone, MP3 player, or any audio source with a standard headphone jack.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Operates on low voltage with high power output for longer range
